Acknowledgement
---------------

This module is mostly the work of Alex Holkner
(alex@partiallydisassembled.net). I have forked the module, in order to
incorporate patches and bugfixes from the issue tracker, and update the
documentation. The original project can be found at
http://code.google.com/p/pyeuclid/

Usage
-----

See "docs/index.rst" for detailed documentation.  The file is readable as
plain text, and can also be compiled to a set of HTML pages with the
included Makefile.
